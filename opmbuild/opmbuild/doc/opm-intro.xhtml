                        The Open Provenance Model is a data model used to represent information
                        about what occurred in the past, specifically what occurred in processes
                        in which data (or physical or conceptual entities) is consumed, transformed,
                        generated, combined etc.  The full specification can be found <a href="http://openprovenance.org">
                            here</a>.  This document is a short introductory guide to the most important
                        concepts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The core data structure in OPM is an <i>OPM graph</i>, a directed acyclic graph
                        in which the nodes represent things which have occurred and the edges denote
                        the <i>causal relationships</i> between them, i.e. occurrence E was caused by
                        (would not have occurred) if not for occurrence C.  The direction of the edges
                        is from effect to cause (i.e. commonly from later to earlier in time).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An example OPM graph is shown above.  The nodes are of three kinds: artifacts
                        (depicted as ovals), processes (depicted as rectangles), and agents (depicted as
                        octagons).  An artifact is a specific piece of data (or physical/conceptual entity)
                        at a given instant in the past.  It therefore has a single, immutable value.
                        A process denotes something dynamic happening, using artifacts (the process' causes)
                        and generating new artifacts (the process' effects).  An agent denotes something
                        which controls the process, e.g. a user.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The edges are of different types depending on what kinds of nodes they link:
                        an edge from a process to an artifact is a <i>used</i> edge, as it denotes the
                        process using the artifact; from an artifact to a process is a <i>was generated by</i>
                        edge, as it denotes the artifact being generated by the process; from one artifact
                        to another is a <i>was derived from</i> edge, as it denotes one artifact deriving
                        from another; from one process to another is a <i>was triggered by</i> edge, denoting
                        one process triggering or influencing another; and, from an agent to a process is a
                        <i>was controlled by</i> edge, denoting the agent having controlled the process.

                    <p>
                        So the above example OPM graph could represent a user having run a compression process.
                        The user would be represented by the agent, the compression by the process, the data
                        before compression by the upper artifact and the data after compression by the lower
                        artifact.  The edges show that the compression process was controlled by the user, used
                        the uncompressed data and generated the compressed data, and that the compressed data
                        was derived from the uncompressed data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The nodes and edges give the bare causal structure of what took place in the past.
                        We then annotate the nodes and edges with key-value pairs (annotations). These
                        capture the details of what occurred, e.g. the value of the data represented by
                        an artifact, the name of the agent, the unique identifier for an artifact etc.
                        The graph above, including annotations, is shown below.

                        Finally, there can be different views, or <i>accounts</i>, of the same occurrence.
                        For instance, two actors may give two independent, possibly contradictory, accounts of
                        how some data was generated.
                        An account is a subgraph of an OPM graph, and may share nodes and edges with other accounts
                        where they overlap (the accounts assert the same thing happening).
                        A particular use of accounts is to describe a process at different levels of detail, so
                        in one account a process is a single node in the OPM graph, while in a different account
                        that process is broken down into a series of connected processes, e.g. we might document
                        how each step in the compression algorithm took place.
                        This is called <i>refinement</i>, as the more detailed account gives a finer granularity
                        of information than the account with a single process.
                        It is possible to see in an OPM graph where one account is a refinement of another because
                        they ultimately use and generate the same artifacts (both the compress process as
                        a single process and the steps of the compression algorithm both input the uncompressed
                        data and output the compressed data.
