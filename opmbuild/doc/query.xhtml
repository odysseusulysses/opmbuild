        <h1>Query Support</h1>
        <p>
            The main aim of the OPM Builder query support is to provide a common
            basis for queries expressed in multiple languages.  As such queries
            takes the form of skeletal, extensible, declarative structures
            which can be compiled into specific languages to execute on specific
            storage mechanisms.  It assumes that there are storage-independent
            aspects to querying OPM graphs, such as recursive traversal through
            the graph, handling sets of edges and nodes etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            It also provides execution of queries over the in-memory OPM object
            model of OPM Builder, along with some queries and query parts commonly
            useful for interrogating OPM graphs.
